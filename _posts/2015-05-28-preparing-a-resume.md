title: Preparing a Resume
---
My first try on an elevator pitch about myself:

On the server side, I enjoy working with Ruby on Rails. I write tests using
rspec but I don't follow a strict Test Driven Development
workflow. The best advise I was given is that I should
never let my own inexperience stop me from writing code and exploring what happens when I run
it. Tests are great to give myself immediate feedback on what I'm programming 
but there's nothing wrong with admitting that I don't know enough to ensure that
my tests are actually useful or that it's hindering me from learning at some
points.
I use Bootstrap or Foundation to start positioning sections of html along grids
and styling common elements like navigitaion bars and form inputs but I know how
to work with css without relying on them. I use jquery to include behavior in the client 
side and I have enough exposure with the ember that I'm very excited to
learn more about what I can build with it.

# General notes from those links

## Elevator Pitch
* Don't sound one dimentional and include your personal passions.
* Say as little as possible.
* Decide what kind of work you're looking for.
* Figure out who you're talking to.
* Ask yourself what problem you solve rather than what you do.
* Describe what you do in one day.
* Include numbers and concrete detail.
* Be quirky or unexpected.
* Take something out.
* Turn it into a conversation.

## Six steps towards a resume

* Identify the job requirements
* Pick a Resume Type
* Create a tailored summary
* List of previous experiences
* Include relevant skills
* Review Format and Feel

## Things to consider

* A screener's job is to quickly screen out the worst resumes.
* Don't use more than one font.
* Check for spelling and grammar mistakes.
* Double checke the dates.
* Delineate sections.
* Don't include an overview section since a cover letter is better for it.
* Include keywords carefully.
* The tech and hr review is further screened by quick decisions and more
  detailed reading. Ensure you pass those quick ones since they're deal breakers
* The three major resume adaptions are tech, hr and a mix of both, figure out
  which once a job post is leaning towards.

## The Three people who read the cover letter

* HR Person / Recruiter - Appropriate skills, Employable, and Eligible
* Hiring Manager - Do you have actual experience, Do you have the other required
  skills, Do you have any open source work
* The Interviewing Developers - Do you know programming, Could they work with
  you, Give them interesting things to talk about you

## Summary Section 

* Help tell them that you're in the right place.
* Demonstrate understanding by being descriptive about your toolset.
* Give interesting topics that other programmers could talk to you about -
  personal development projects.

## Skills

* Talk about important things first.
* Talk about experiences as proof that you've actually used the tools you talk
  about.
* Insights gained from experience and something you could talk about in an
  interview.
* Talk about something slightly contentious and this gives an interviewer
  something to ask and something you can prepare for.
* 'some exposure' is a great phrase to point to something you've played with
  before but aren't prepared to answer in detail.
* Certain skills in bold for recruiters.
* User the same approach for non language specific skills.
* Demonstrate understanding by giving opinions.
* Throw in a little bit of personality but don't go overboard.
* Throw in other things that aren't too important at the end.

## Open Source Experience

* Make it prominent if you have a lot of it.
* Link to your blog if you have great content and only mention it if you don't.
* If you don't have a lot of it, talk about things you've done outside of work
  or what you've learned like online courses.

## Other stuff

* Unless you have something awesome to share, leave out Education
* If you did not finish your degree, then write in the amount of credits that
  you obtained, what major you pursued, and relevant coursework taken.


## Outside the resume

* Have an online footprint
* Links to portfolio, projects, and GitHub then review them
* Prioritize work that's relevant to the position
* A bulleted list of links in your cover email
* Employers will google you


## Commands I've learned
* `git commit --amend`
* `git log --pretty=oneline` shows a terse history mapping containing the commit
  id and the summary
* `git rebase --interactive` provides the summary for each commit in the editor
  it invokes
* `git config --global alias.home 'rev-parse --show-toplevel'` - `cd 'git home'`
