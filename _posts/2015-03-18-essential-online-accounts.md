title: Accounts I should have had from the beginning
---
When I first started learning about coding, I was reading through Zed Shaw's
[book](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) about Python. The very first program I
made was based on the text game in one of the [exercises](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex31.html). It was
a game that would give me suggestions or try to motivate me in some way based on
how I answered questions. It was a really bad example of programming with
many nested `if..else` statements, but I believe that working through that game
was ultimately the reason why I kept trying to learn. Unfortunately, I lost that 
game when my computer was stolen. Which brings me to the first thing I should
have gotten when I started, a way to backup my files. 

[Github](http://github.com) is the most popular
choice from but I was always afraid to show really bad code or
accidently sharing something personal like passwords or api keys. That's the reason that I
put off starting one for a long time. I became more diligent about backups after losing all the tutorial applications
and links that I was saving. Around that time, I created an account at [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) because it allowed free
private repositories and it helped me get started using [git](http://gitref.org/) 
commands. Starting with Github first would have helped me get over the hump about
sharing or talking with other programmers but if that barrier is too big at the
moment, it's better to go with the alternative than not at all.

Another thing I should have started from the beginning was working through an
app from `rails new appname` to deploying it. I put off this part for awhile 
and it was a huge detriment later on. Personally, my fear of
deploying a demo was similar to my fear of the command line in the
beginning. A major part of that was connecting and using a Database that wasn't
[sqlite](https://sqlite.org/) along with the other configurations. 
I knew enough about SQL and databases in general 
to work with it in a Rails app but that was different from having
to configure it outside a development environment. For demos and trying to deploy the first time, [heroku](http://heroku.com)
is my number one choice because it was the most painless for me, the most that I
had to do was extract out some keys to environment variables and add a
different Ruby server besides WEBrick. Their articles
guided me on how to deploy for the first time and the reasons why they require
programs to be deployed in that way.

The last thing I focused on in the beginning was that I put a lot of time doing
exercises like [ruby koans](http://rubykoans.com/) and [exercism](http://exercism.io/) 
because it abstracted out a lot of parts that I couldn't get my head around yet. 
I only found these exercises through GitHub and in the latter's case, it's the
only way to access the exercises and let other users comment on your work. 
I was ignorant to the design patterns other people were using since I was so 
focused on just making the tests pass, but I used them to become familiar with the
syntax and the way Ruby solved problems. Aiming to work on one problem a day was
an attainable enough goal to create a habit and eventually fall in love with the
process. As an added benefit, those exercises
gave me a great appreciation of testing in general because that was the only way 
I knew if I was doing the right things.
