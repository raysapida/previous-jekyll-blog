title: Going through Thinkful's Front End Course
---
For the past three weeks, I've been going through [Thinkful's Front End
Course](https://www.thinkful.com/courses/learn-web-development-online/). A major
reason that I chose this course was information I heard from an
[episode](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/186) of the Ruby on Rails podcast where
their CEO talked about programming schools in general and their program specifically.
I liked the fact that they made their program more accessible to people and that
they place an emphasis on students pacing themselves instead of requiring the
maximum time possible.
Even though the payments are still relatively
expensive compared to other online courses, the fact that it doesn't require a
long term commitment was a huge plus. That and the
chance to talk to a professional web developer about my code was what sealed it
for me.

For a long time, I knew the basics of CSS and front end development when I read
it, but I wasn't able to use it off the top of my head. I liken it to being
able to answer a multiple choice question but failing on the free response ones.
Most of what I did before this course was limited to using bootstrap, adding 
markup to html to correspond with the grids and using their stylings for common
components like navigation and form fields.

A lot of the starting material was stuff that I've seen before but using it in
practice without a step by step guide made a huge difference. This was also a
time when another person was actually critiquing my programs and giving me
constructive feedback on how to make it better. That feedback alone encouraged
me to work at least twice as hard as I would have otherwise because 
I had someone else to keep me accountable.

I was able to make a static [portfolio
site](http://raysapida.github.io/raymond-sapida-portfolio/) that I'm planning to
migrate to its own domain in the future along with multiple projects to showcase
with it. I've already included two demo Rails app I made and I'm planning to
add more once I deploy them to heroku. All of this is still a work in progress
but it's really invigorating to see my work displayed like that. I'm looking 
forward writing a blog post on each project I made in the course and also using 
the things I learned to edit the css for this blog.
