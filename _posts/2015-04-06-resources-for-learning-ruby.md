title: Resources for Learning Ruby
---
Since I've been learning on my own, I've found that there are many resources
online to help me chart a syllabus and figure out what skills I would
specifically need. These are some of the links I bookmarked to figure out what I have to
start learning next or what I need to work on more. 

## [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses)

This was one of the first free resources I found online about web development.
The format for this was similar to Treehouse's tracks except that this one is
written instead of as video tutorials.

## [Thoughtbot Guides](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides)

This covered a lot of detail about the tools thoughtbot uses. I'm not familiar
with all of them but I found that the ones I do know are covered very well here.
It's not an introduction to them but, if you just started working with it, the
guides offer general guidelines to follow until their purposes are better
understood. 

## [Sitepoint Ruby](http://www.sitepoint.com/ruby/)

Sitepoint has a lot of introductory material or tutorials on how to use
libraries or frameworks. There's a great variety in what they've written about
and they publish frequently enough that there are a lot of material to go
through that is very up to date.

## [Jumpstart Lab Tutorials](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/)

This site has a lot of projects a person could go through and create. I found
their github repository a while back and saw a lot of sample apps that could be
used to learn about a specific functionality. 

## [Turing Standards](http://standards.turing.io/)

This site has a lot of questions a Ruby on Rails developer could be reasonable
asked. I go 
through them because I feel like they're a very good example of interview questions. 

## [Practicing Ruby](https://practicingruby.com/)

These articles are very in-depth and valuable to learning more than just the
basics of different Ruby categories. In particular, my favorite was the
[article](https://practicingruby.com/articles/building-enumerable-and-enumerator)
 about building the Enumerable module from scratch. I consider that module as one
of the most important in Ruby's standard library since it's used a lot by Ruby
programmers. 

## [Rails Diff](http://railsdiff.org/)

Since a lot of Rails tutorials can include previous versions of Rails, I use
this a lot to make sure the ones I'm following could be easily migrated to a 
more current version. 

## [Ruby Regex](http://rubular.com/)

This is an interactive app to check Ruby regular expressions and their results. 
I use this a lot to make sure the regular expressions I'm using are correct.
When I first started learning about regex, I used this website to practice
different characters and shortcuts. 

## [Awesome Ruby](http://marcanguera.net/awesome-ruby/)

This is a collection of libraries and tools that are written in Ruby. Looking at
all of this was overwhelming at first but it's a really great way to see what's
out there and what you could use. The first thing I looked at from here was the
coding style guides which include resources for Ruby, Rails, and Rspec. 

## [Big O](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

This was a good introduction on data structures and algorithms in Computer
Science. I don't use the specific things in here very much but having a working
understanding of these concepts are helpful to decide which methods to use.
Also, I've been told this is a common interview question that could stump entry
level programmers especially self taught ones. 

## Commands I've learned
* `find / -type d -name 'folder_name'`
