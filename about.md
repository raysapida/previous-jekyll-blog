I'm an aspiring web developer and  I hack together words hoping that they'll make sense to another human being. There are many hidden shadows and alleyways hiding in between but as I understand more, I learn to shine a light in those dark corners. I’m making my own pathway to the exit and once I’m there, I restart again to create more forks in the road , branch out to different possibilities, add to the stages of my education, commit them to memory, and then push them to the forefront.

Who I am after all my tests pass
